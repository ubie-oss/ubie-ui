Ubie UI is a library for distributing components defined in Ubie's design system, Ubie Vitals.
It is designed to be implemented in React-based projects.

## Components

A list of components can be found on the documentation site.
https://vitals.ubie.life/components

## Installation

```sh
npm install @ubie/ubie-ui
```

You need to install React and React-DOM as peerDependencies.

```sh
npm install react react-dom
```

## Usage

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { Button } from '@ubie/ubie-ui';

function App() {
  return <Button>Ubie Vitals</Button>;
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.querySelector('#app'));
```

## Development

This repository uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) for package management.

```sh
pnpm install
```

### Creating a new component

You can start creating a new component with the following command:

```sh
pnpm run generate
```

This command will also update the `src/index.ts` file (it's called a ["Barrel"](https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/main-1/barrel)) at the same time.

#### Example

To add a new component named `Button`:

```sh
? Please select the output destination directory. src
? Please enter a component name. Button
